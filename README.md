# Temporal Exploitability Scoring System (TESS)
This repository contains TESS, a Temporal Exploitability Scoring System.

The development of this project has been completed but its effectiveness was never validated in a meaningful way due to the lack of public IPS/IDS data.

The objective of TESS was to predict the exploitability of software vulnerabilities based on their lifecycle and the context of the targeted system.

A [report](/report.pdf) is available with the details of the project.
